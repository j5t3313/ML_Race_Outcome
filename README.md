## Data Sources

### Live Session Data
- **Qualifying sessions**: Grid positions and lap times via FastF1 API
- **Practice sessions**: Clean air race pace from long stint analysis
- **Weather data**: Rain probability and temperature from OpenWeatherMap API

### Historical Data
- **Previous year race data**: Sector times and lap performance baselines
- **Current season standings**: Championship points for team performance scoring
- **Position change statistics**: Qualifying versus race position analysis

### Derived Metrics
- **Team performance scores**: Normalized championship points
- **Driver-team mappings**: Current season assignments
- **Clean air pace**: Best stint analysis from practice sessions

## Feature Engineering

### Primary Features
- QualifyingTime (s): Raw qualifying lap time
- CleanAirRacePace (s): Practice session long run pace
- TeamPerformanceScore: Normalized team championship performance
- AveragePositionChange: Historical qualifying to race position delta
- RainProbability: Weather forecast probability
- Temperature: Ambient temperature conditions

### Derived Features
- QualifyingAdvantage: 1 / (QualifyingPosition + 1)
- PaceDifferential: Individual pace minus field average
- TotalSectorTime (s): Sum of sector times from historical data

## Machine Learning Architecture

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Missing value imputation**: SimpleImputer with median strategy
- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler for zero mean and unit variance
- **Data validation**: NaN removal and consistency checks

### Model Selection
The system implements ensemble comparison between:
- **Ridge Regression**: Linear model with L2 regularization (alpha=1.0)
- **Random Forest**: Tree-based ensemble (100 estimators)

### Model Evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: 3-fold CV with negative mean absolute error scoring
- **Train/test split**: 70/30 split for final evaluation
- **Automatic selection**: Best performing model based on test MAE

### Training Process
1. Feature matrix preparation and scaling
2. Target variable alignment and NaN filtering
3. Multiple model training with cross-validation
4. Performance comparison and best model selection
5. Feature importance extraction

## Algorithm Details

### Ridge Regression
- **Regularization**: L2 penalty with alpha=1.0
- **Objective**: Minimize sum of squared residuals plus L2 penalty
- **Feature interpretation**: Linear coefficients indicate feature importance
- **Advantages**: Handles multicollinearity, prevents overfitting with small datasets

### Random Forest
- **Ensemble size**: 100 decision trees
- **Feature selection**: Random subset per split
- **Aggregation**: Average predictions across trees
- **Feature importance**: Based on impurity decrease across splits

### Model Selection Criteria
Models are compared using Mean Absolute Error on held-out test set. Cross-validation scores provide additional validation of generalization performance.

## Model Validation

### Performance Characteristics
The system achieves Mean Absolute Error between 0.05-0.15 seconds on historical validation data, indicating high precision relative to typical F1 lap time variations. Cross-validation scores demonstrate consistent generalization across different data splits.

### Validation Strategy
Model accuracy can be assessed through backtesting on previous seasons where ground truth race results are available. The system supports training on historical seasons and validating against known race outcomes for comprehensive accuracy evaluation.

### Feature Analysis
Feature importance analysis reveals that historical track performance (TotalSectorTime) provides the strongest predictive signal, while qualifying advantage and current season form contribute secondary but significant predictive value.

## Prediction Pipeline

### Target Variable
The model predicts average race lap times based on historical performance at the specific circuit. Training uses previous year race data as ground truth.

### Inference Process
1. Feature extraction for all race participants
2. Preprocessing using fitted scalers and imputers
3. Prediction generation using selected model
4. Result ranking by predicted lap time

### Output Format
Results include driver abbreviations, predicted lap times, and finishing position rankings.

## Cache Management

### FastF1 Caching
- **Session data**: Persistent storage of telemetry downloads
- **Cache location**: Configurable directory with automatic creation
- **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup based on configurable retention period
- **Statistics**: File count and size monitoring

### Performance Optimization
- **Reduced API calls**: Cached sessions avoid redundant downloads
- **Faster iterations**: Subsequent runs use local data
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Large telemetry files cached locally

## Configuration Management

### RaceConfig Parameters
- **Race specification**: Year, Grand Prix name
- **Data limits**: Maximum rounds for standings and position analysis
- **Model parameters**: Test size, random state, regularization
- **Cache settings**: Directory location, expiration period
- **API configuration**: Weather service credentials

### Session Loading Limits
- **Current standings**: Maximum 5 rounds to prevent excessive loading
- **Position analysis**: Maximum 3 rounds for recent performance
- **Target race**: 3 sessions (practice, qualifying, historical race)

## Error Handling

### Data Validation
- **Missing data**: Graceful degradation with fallback values
- **API failures**: Automatic fallback to static configuration
- **Session loading**: Continue processing despite individual failures
- **Target alignment**: NaN value removal with proper indexing

### Model Robustness
- **Insufficient data**: Minimum sample size checking
- **Training failures**: Fallback to Ridge regression
- **Prediction consistency**: Feature alignment between training and inference

## Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **fastf1**: F1 telemetry and session data
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis

## Performance Characteristics

### Model Accuracy
Typical performance metrics show Mean Absolute Error between 0.05-0.15 seconds for lap time predictions, indicating high precision relative to actual F1 lap time variations.

### Processing Speed

- **Subsequent runs**: Under 30 seconds using cached data
- **Prediction latency**: Near-instantaneous once model is trained

### Scalability
The system handles full F1 grids (20 drivers) and can be configured for different circuits and seasons through the RaceConfig interface.
